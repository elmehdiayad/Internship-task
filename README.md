# Internship-task
Proposal for Software Development internship task

What I did is a web app written in Python(dash Cytoscape), that allows a user to show and update a 3 node graph:
- when you click on a node, it shows you the label at the top, and the color, width, height so you can change them, the update is made automatically so the user doesn't have to press a button.
any question is welcome!
to run the code you need to install dash and its dependent libraries: 
pip install dash dash-html-componentsthen 
install dash-Cytoscape : 
pip install dash-cytoscapeand 
then run python app.py.
